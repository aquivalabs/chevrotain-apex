###### This was originally forked from [thorbenvh8/chevrotain-java](https://github.com/thorbenvh8/chevrotain-java) but due to heavy changes I decided to move to another repo, not linked to chevrotain-java.

###### Special thanks to [thorbenvh8](https://github.com/thorbenvh8) and the whole team behind [chevrotain-java](https://github.com/thorbenvh8/chevrotain-java) and [prettier-java](https://github.com/thorbenvh8/prettier-java)
